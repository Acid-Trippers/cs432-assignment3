"""
Ingests raw data from the local API endpoint and yields it in manageable chunks.

- Requests a specified number of records from the API in a streamed connection.
- Chunks incoming data into batches to stream directly into the memory pipeline.
- Preserves a persistent counter across runs using `counter.txt` to track total fetched records.
- Appends an ingestion timestamp (`sys_ingested_time`) to every fetched record.

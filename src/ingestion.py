"""
- Task: Ingest data from the API endpoint and store it in a file.
- The script will request a specified number of records from the API and append them to a local file called "received_data.json".
- It also maintains a counter of total records fetched across runs in "counter.txt" to track progress.
- Usage: Run this script with the number of records you want to fetch as a command-line argument, e.g., `python ingestion.py 1000`
